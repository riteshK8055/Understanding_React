# React + Vite
 
in this project i used useState hook and this proiject is created to understand how useState hook works behind the Scene and how it is used to reflect changes in UI , 

# syntax

let{value, setValue} = useStae(0);

here value = variable 
     
     inside useState variable is initialized

     setValue is a function responsible for updating variable
